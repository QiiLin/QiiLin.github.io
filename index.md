### About Me
I am a recent new graduate from the computer science specialist program at the University of Toronto.
In the past few years, I have developed a good understanding of programing language such as Java, JavaScript, 
Python, C. In addition, I gained a good grasp of algorithm design and machine learning concepts. I am looking forward to applying those skills in my future position. 

I am currently seeking a full-time/internship software engineer ole around Canada.
